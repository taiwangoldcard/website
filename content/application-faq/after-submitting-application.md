Congratulations on getting the application in.

At this point you will receive an email at this point telling you to pay.
If you didn't get it, check your email address was correct.

_You must now go through the payment steps in order for your application to be considered._

Log in to the portal at:
[https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card](https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card)

click "Online Payment" and select "Permit Payment", then follow the steps.

After completing the payment, you will receive an email at this point telling you to get your receipt.
 You will need to print this out to collect your card, so do it now.

Still in the [portal](https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card),
 click "Download" and select "Receipt Download". Enter your application number and today's date.

The next three steps in the process are: Qualification Assessment, Identity Verification and Card Collection.
During these steps, you can check the status if your application by logging in to the portal.

## Qualification Assessment
🕑 2-4 weeks

After a quick sanity check by the National Immigration Agency, your qualifications will be assessed.
If you login to the portal to check your application status, you'll see it go from "Under Review"
 to "待二審" (secondary inspection) to "Professional Review by Workforce Development Agency".

Once your application reaches this stage, it will stay on this status for weeks.

What's happening in the background is: 
1. First, the Ministry of Labor will attempt to sign off on the work permit. If it can do this itself (eg you apply based on the salary criteria and provide the right documents), your application will be swift (one case took just two days).
1. Most likely, the Ministry of Labor will need call in the appropriate Ministry (eg "Science and Technology) to assist. That Ministry will then create a custom panel of judges who are skilled in your area of application.

This takes some time, and if you are skilled in a niche area expect the application to take longer than 30 days at this stage.


If the status in the portal hasn't updated in a long time first try contacting WDA, under the _Ministry of Labor for Employment Gold Card Permits for Foreign Special Professionals_ on the [master contact list](https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=D927ED39BDAE7478&s=DA2F7BC919B77E24).
 They will probably tell you that the application is with the relevant ministry for your skill set and provide contact details.
 If not, try to contact the appropriate ministry under _Qualification of Foreign Special Professionals_ on the master list


### What do I do if I'm asked to provide additional documents?
After a few weeks of tense wait, you may receive an email from niasys@immigration.gov.tw that says
"After the examination by the department and the enterprise competent authority, the relevant information shall be made up.".

Log in to the portal at:
[https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card](https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card)

Your application will be listed under "Application cases of which data to be supplemented", click "View".

Up the top of the application will be a block of red text in Chinese and English. It will attempt
 to explain what additional documents are required. If it doesn't make sense, call the appropriate
ministry contact under Qualification of Foreign Special Professionals on the master list. They'll be
 able to look up your application and provide more colour.

Once you know which documents to upload, prepare to upload them as with your previous application.
 Additionally, prepare a short statement addressing how you have rectified the "Opinion
 on the Application". Select the documents for upload and paste the response in the "Reply Comments"
 box at the bottom of the final page.

_Important: Sometimes using English in the "Reply Comments" box will cause your application to fail
 to be submitted with a cryptic error._

### I applied under a salary provision, but am being asked for additional documents unrelated to this. Why?
Don’t stress. This is normal. You’re applying under a financial requirement, but the relevant
 ministry still wants to vet your skills. Under some interpretations of the regulations, they
 are not supposed to do this, but here we are.

Gather up some documents that demonstrate you work in the industry and you’re good at it. Maybe a
 letter from your boss talking about that time you created that innovative thing, a supporting
 statement from a professor about how they’re proud of you, a piece of easily digestible work
 product that has your name on it. It’ll depend on what you’ve got or can create - but get into
 the mindset of the reviewer and aim to make it as easy as possible to understand why you are a
 talent. If you feel the need, write a cover letter for your application explaining your skills.
