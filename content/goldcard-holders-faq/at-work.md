## What do I need to tell my employer about the Gold Card?
Your Gold Card is a four-in-one document that contains your work permit, residence visa, reentry
 permit and Alien Residence Certificate. You have open work rights and they do not need to apply
 for a work permit or visa for you.

## What happens if I lose my job?
You may simply find a new job. Your Gold Card is not sponsored by your employer and will not be
 affected by a change of job.

## Can I start a business with a Gold Card?
Yes.

## Does the Gold Card provide an open work permit?
Yes. You may work for any organisation (or many organisations at the same time) in any industry,
 in any job, provided it doesn't have licensing requirements that you don't meet.

## Can I be self-employed?
Yes.

## Is there a minimum salary requirement for Gold Card holders?
Yes. It is one of:

* NT$23,800 a month, or NT$158 per hour for "workers" (Labor Standards Act Article 21)
* NT$47,971 a month for those performing "specialised or technical work" 

Despite many applicants qualifying for a gold card on the basis of previous employment with salary
 of greater than NT$160,000, this is not a minimum salary requirement. _However_, those applying
 under this category will have their financial data reviewed by the Ministry of Labor. The
 regulations allow the Ministry of Labor to revoke a work permit if they are not satisfied with
 the results of this review.

## Can I work for multiple companies at the same time?
Yes.

## What is salary withholding tax? At what rate should my salary be withheld?
In May each year you pay income tax on your earnings from the previous year. To smooth out your
 payments (and when the government receives money) a little, the Taiwanese tax system is designed
 so that your employer effectively pre-pays a little bit of your tax. To do that, they
 "withhold" a percentage of your salary payment each time you get paid and remit it to
 the government a few times a year. The tax you pay in May will be reduced by this amount.

There are two common amounts you will see for salary withholding tax: 18% and 5%. For
 tax residents of Taiwan, employers should withhold 5% and non-tax-residents 18%.
 However, some companies work on the assumption that all foreign residents have a danger of
 leaving Taiwan each year before they achieve tax residency (i.e. less than 183 days).
 These types of companies typically withold 18% from January to June, and 5% for the rest of
 the year, which protects the company from owing additional tax to the government if the
 employee leaves.

Which withholding rate you are charged is not a large issue, as it directly contributes to your
 income tax payment. If you've been charged too much, you will receive a refund from the
 government once you file your income tax. However, it is always worth talking with your
 employer to explain your circumstances and that you plan to reside in Taiwan long-term.
