## What happens if I get married to a Taiwanese citizen while on a Gold Card?
Congratulations on your marriage. Though you may become eligible for other visas due to
 this, you may continue to use your Gold Card. 

## If I switch from a Gold Card to permanent residence, can my family switch too?
When you have been approved for permanent residence, your children (under 20) and your spouse
 may also apply for permanent residency if they have lived in Taiwan for more than 183 days per year
 for the past five years. Additionally, as a Gold Card holder your family members aren't required to show
 proof of financial ability like some other applicants for permanent residence. ([Article 16](https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=A0030295))

## My child just turned 20, can they get their own work permit?
Yes, provided they have lived in Taiwan from the time before they were 16 years old, for more
than 270 days per year. ([Article 17](https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=A0030295))

## Can my parents or grandparents come to visit?
Yes, as a Gold Card holder, your parents and grandparents are eligible to apply for a 1 year
 multi-entry visa for a maximum stay of six months at a time. This visa can be extended in Taiwan
 to allow for a maximum stay of one year at a time. Contact your nearest Taiwan diplomatic post or
the Bureau of Consular Affairs to apply.
