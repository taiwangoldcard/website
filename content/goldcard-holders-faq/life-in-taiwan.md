## How do I find a place to rent?
Renting is common in Taiwan, and there are a large range of types of dwellings available
 at diffrerent price points. The most popular property search website is [591](https://www.591.com.tw).
 Unlike in some other countries, real estate agents offering rental properties in Taiwan are typically
 only brokers who present prospective tenants to landlords for a fee and you will normally deal directly
 with a landlord from lease signing onward. Standard leases are available from most convenience
 stores and it is common to use these. A one or two month deposit, refunded on leaving the property
 is common. Negotiation down from the advertised price is common. Properties close to MRT stations
 are the most desirable.

If you are looking for newer, tall modern apartment buildings, these are known as "電梯大樓" and you
 can limit your search on 591 to this. Other search sites include [myroomabroad](https://myroomabroad.com)
 and [spacious](https://www.spacious.tw/zh-tw/c/%E5%8F%B0%E5%8C%97).There are also facebook groups for finding rental properties and some units are also advertised on facebook marketplace. 

## Can I purchase real-estate?
In general, yes, if your country allows Taiwanese nationals to purchase real estate in your
 country. There are some restrictions, such as not being able to purchase farmland, or land
 related to a waterway or national defense.

## Does my card look any different from other types of ARC?
Yes, the entire card is gold in colour. It also has slightly different information such as a
 different title (R.O.C. (Taiwan) Employment Gold Card), purpose of residence (Foreign Special
 Professional) and a label for your professional field.

## How do I register to use the e-Gate?
Visit your local NIA service center or the immigration counter at an international airport and the
officials there will guide you through the steps.

## What unofficial benefits does holding a Gold Card bestow?
As the Taiwan government sees holders as "worthy professionals", this could increase your standing in
the eyes of certain people. Additionally, Sometimes the National Development Council or other
government agencies invite us to parties or ask our opinions on certain matters.

## How do I convert my overseas driving license?
Taiwan has international agreements with many countries that allow you to convert your driver's license
 from your home country into a Taiwanese license without taking a driving test. This is done on the
 basis of 'reciprocity' - basically if it is possible for a Taiwanese national to convert their license
 in your country you should be able to do the same in Taiwan. The Taipei City Motor Vehicles Office
 maintains a list of eligible countries (and states within countries), and instructions
 [on their website](https://tpcmv.thb.gov.tw/English/ServicesEng/LicenseEng/ManagementEng/ManagementEng02.htm).

If you are not from an eligible state or country and need to drive long-term, you will need to
 sit the local license test. For the short term, you may use an International Driving Permit (IDP) from
 your home country, but after 30 days in Taiwan this [must be validated](https://tpcmv.thb.gov.tw/english/ServicesEng/LicenseEng/ManagementEng/ManagementEng01.htm) by the local Motor Vehicles
 Office to remain valid. A validated IDP can typically only be used for a maximum of six months, 
 after which you are supposed to apply for a Taiwanese driver's license.

 ## What is the use of a Taiwan International Driving Permit (IDP)? How can I get one?
 If you have a full valid Taiwanese driving license of any kind, you can go to the Motor Vehicles Office in your local vicinity and get a Taiwan International Driving Permit. It has the same use case as other IDPs, but you should make sure that the foreign countries you wish to drive in accept your Taiwan IDP. There is a cost involved in printing your IDP, check with your local Motor Vehicles Offices.
 Note: Make sure you give the correct details for your home country to be used on your IDP. It is not common for foreign nationals to request a Taiwan IDP and when the clerk is issuing your IDP, they have to manually enter your home country (there is no dropdown or sanitisation check). In order to avoid costly mistakes, be firm and make sure that the clerk who is issuing your IDP writes down your country exactly as you ask them to (for example, if you are a UK national it is very possible that they may look at the full name of your UK passport and write down an abbreviated version which could result in your IDP stating 'Ireland' when you are in fact a British national from another region). Be careful with the storage and usage of your new Taiwan IDP, as they are not laminated.

 ## I want to convert a full valid UK driving license to a Taiwanese driving license. What does this entail and how do I change it back later?
 As of January 2022, it became possible to change your full clean UK driving license to a full Taiwanese driving license.
 The most obvious benefit of doing so is you can immediately drive a car, either manual or automatic (depending on your license type in the UK).
 You can also drive 'General Light Motorcycles' - in other words, any scooter that is equal to or less than 50cc. This includes GoShares and the likes.
 Be aware though that most scooters driven around are 50 - 250cc which are classed as 'General Heavy Motorcycles' by definition and require you to pass a seperate test from scratch.
 The process of swapping your UK license from within Taiwan is very quick, cheap and easy. You pay a fee (including any other documents you may need, such as a photo for your new license and a health check from the nearby hospital) for <1000NTD. You will get your license printed then and there on the same day.
 Once you are ready to return to the UK you can return your Taiwanese license for a UK one, but it is an application in itself and much more involved than swapping it for the Taiwanese license. It is also important to note that you can still legally drive for up to a year each time you return to the UK using your Taiwanese license (but be sure to insure your vehicle under your foreign license for legal purposes).
 You need to hand your Taiwanese license over to one of the embassies of Taiwan in the UK for notarisation, either; The Taipei Representative Office in the UK (London) or (Edinburgh). There is a fee for doing so, but check with the embassy to see exactly how much.
 In the Edinburgh office, things usually go much quicker and you can expect to get your Taiwanese license and the notarised documents back in an envelope within around 3 weeks (or long if busier), the London office is much busier and this process can take anywhere up to three months, as quoted by them.
 It is important to note that instructions on how to notarise your license and exchange it for a UK one are in Mandarin only and were not initially intended for an english-speaking audience, as this whole process is very new. So go into your embassy of choice and explain the situation, they will help you to send off your documents for notarisaion and collect the fee. You may want to get a first class stamp and a large plastic postal bag (they are grey in colour) to save some time, as this will likely be asked for (at your expense).
 Once you are ready, pick up a D1 Driver's License Application Form from any post office (or order one online) and fill out the swapping a foreign driver's license section. Include your Taiwanese driving license and the notarised documents in the same envelope as your D1 and send it off to DVLA Swansea. You should receive your UK driving license back within 3 weeks (this process is free).
 Note: Do NOT send your Taiwan license off without notarisation documents from Taiwan. You will receive your DVLA forms back and your Taiwan license with instructions on how to notarise your documents.

## I am being asked to see an entry stamp in my passport, but I always use the eGate. What do I do?
These days, most foreign residents of Taiwan use the eGate exclusively to enter and exit the
 country. It's fast and convenient, but it has the side effect that your passport is no longer
 stamped to mark your entry or exit. You may be met with confusion when explaining this to a
 bureaucrat in some situations. To solve this, you can visit your local National Immigration
 Agency service center  and ask for a
 [Certificate of Entry/Exit](https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141465/141808/180164/).
 It costs NT$100 and takes only a few minutes to produce. You can also
 [apply for one online](https://ncp.immigration.gov.tw/niaweb/entryExitForeignQuery) if
 you have a digital citizen certificate.
