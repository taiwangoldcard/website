## How do I find a place to rent?
Renting is common in Taiwan, and there are a large range of types of dwellings available
 at diffrerent price points. The most popular property search website is [591](https://www.591.com.tw).
 Unlike in some other countries, real estate agents offering rental properties in Taiwan are typically
 only brokers who present prospective tenants to landlords for a fee and you will normally deal directly
 with a landlord from lease signing onward. Standard leases are available from most convenience
 stores and it is common to use these. A one or two month deposit, refunded on leaving the property
 is common. Negotiation down from the advertised price is common. Properties close to MRT stations
 are the most desirable.

If you are looking for newer, tall modern apartment buildings, these are known as "電梯大樓" and you
 can limit your search on 591 to this. Other search sites include [myroomabroad](https://myroomabroad.com)
 and [spacious](https://www.spacious.tw/zh-tw/c/%E5%8F%B0%E5%8C%97).

## Can I purchase real-estate?
In general, yes, if your country allows Taiwanese nationals to purchase real estate in your
 country. There are some restrictions, such as not being able to purchase farmland, or land
 related to a waterway or national defense.

## Does my card look any different from other types of ARC?
Yes, the entire card is gold in colour. It also has slightly different information such as a
 different title (R.O.C. (Taiwan) Employment Gold Card), purpose of residence (Foreign Special
 Professional) and a label for your professional field.

## How do I register to use the e-Gate?
Visit your local NIA service center or the immigration counter at an international airport and the
officials there will guide you through the steps.

## What unofficial benefits does holding a Gold Card bestow?
As the Taiwan government sees holders as "worthy professionals", this could increase your standing in
the eyes of certain people. Additionally, Sometimes the National Development Council or other
government agencies invite us to parties or ask our opinions on certain matters.

- Some government entities, such as the tax office or NHI, won't accept any other address
than the one mentioned in your Gold Card.

miss them.

## How many days per year do I have to stay in Taiwan?
There are no requirements. However, you must stay for more than 183 days per year in order to be
 eligible for many benefits such as: tax resident treatment and a pathway to permanent residence.

## How do I convert my overseas driving license?
Taiwan has international agreements with many countries that allow you to convert your driver's license
 from your home country into a Taiwanese license without taking a driving test. This is done on the
 basis of 'reciprocity' - basically if it is possible for a Taiwanese national to convert their license
 in your country you should be able to do the same in Taiwan. The Taipei City Motor Vehicles Office
 maintains a list of eligible countries (and states within countries), and instructions
 [on their website](https://tpcmv.thb.gov.tw/English/ServicesEng/LicenseEng/ManagementEng/ManagementEng02.htm).

If you are not from an eligible state or country and need to drive long-term, you will need to
 sit the local license test. For the short term, you may use an International Driving Permit (IDP) from
 your home country, but after 30 days in Taiwan this [must be validated](https://tpcmv.thb.gov.tw/english/ServicesEng/LicenseEng/ManagementEng/ManagementEng01.htm) by the local Motor Vehicles
 Office to remain valid. A validated IDP can typically only be used for a maximum of six months, 
 after which you are supposed to apply for a Taiwanese driver's license.

## I am being asked to see an entry stamp in my passport, but I always use the eGate. What do I do?
These days, most foreign residents of Taiwan use the eGate exclusively to enter and exit the
 country. It's fast and convenient, but it has the side effect that your passport is no longer
 stamped to mark your entry or exit. You may be met with confusion when explaining this to a
 bureaucrat in some situations. To solve this, you can visit your local National Immigration
 Agency service center  and ask for a
 [Certificate of Entry/Exit](https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141465/141808/180164/).
 It costs NT$100 and takes only a few minutes to produce. You can also
 [apply for one online](https://ncp.immigration.gov.tw/niaweb/entryExitForeignQuery) if
 you have a digital citizen certificate.
