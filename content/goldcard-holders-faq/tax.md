## How do I apply for the tax relief for Foreign Special Professionals?
As a Gold Card holder working in Taiwan for the first time, for the portion of your salary over
 NT $3 million, half of it can be excluded from your effective income for your first three years
 of residence. eg if your salary was NT $6 million, you only pay tax on NT $4.5 million.

There is a special form accessible from both the [Alien e-Filing system](https://tax.nat.gov.tw/alltax.html?id=9)
 and the [paper-based tax return application](https://www.ntbt.gov.tw/multiplehtml/e4591ae68b83403eb8282d746614311f).

## If I have worked in Taiwan before, can I apply for the tax break?

Generally no, with some exceptions. The relevant regulations are [here](https://law.moj.gov.tw/eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=G0340150%204).
 You can see in Article 3 that you need 3 ticks to be eligible:

1. First time coming to work
1. It’s special professional work
1. No household registration (only applicable to ROC nationals) and not a tax resident for the prior 5 years


With the exception that:

>  “If a foreign special professional has been previously approved to reside in the R.O.C. before
> his/her employment engaged in the professional work in the R.O.C., and such approval is not given
> on the ground of his/her engagement in the professional work, he/she shall not be subject to the
> first-time approval requirement…”

Which is unclear.

In 2019, [an interpretation](https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/News_Content.aspx?n=F0746484B877D582&s=AB4D1406453F1C22)
 was issued on this matter. An attempt to explain it is below, but this
 has not been validated by official sources.

If you came to Taiwan in 2015/2016/2017 and had a single 3/2/1 year work contract that ended in 2018
 and you became a Gold Card holder in 2018 and got a new contract … for financial year 2018 (and 2019
 and 2020) you can claim the Gold Card tax break.


You are not eligible under this interpretation if:
* you worked in Taiwan before 2015
* your contract didn’t extend into 2018
* you had multiple contracts between 2015 and 2018.
* you became a gold card holder in 2019

## When do I file tax in Taiwan?
The financial year is January 1st to December 31st. Tax is filed each year from May 1st to the end of the month. 

2020 benefits from an [extended deadline due to the COVID-19](https://home.kpmg/us/en/home/insights/2020/04/tnf-taiwan-tax-return-tax-payment-deadlines-extended-covid-19.html). You are allowed to fill tax until the 30rd June 2020.

## How do I calculate my tax?
A useful [tax calculator is available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_UNRjnQXEdcUYLkw-Hqo1K22RE1QAjIFelvtp0nD0mY/edit#gid=1372091174), if you need a rough estimate and can't work the [official
website](https://www.etax.nat.gov.tw/etwmain/front/ETW158W13?site=en).

## Where can I go for help with my taxes?
The National Taxation Bureau provides free professional taxation consultation sessions [in English and Japanese](https://www.ntbt.gov.tw/English/multiplehtml/51c544ce868347fa85b4d63bcaee4559).
During "tax season" there are dedicated English language counters for tax filing at
National Taxation Bureau offices in major cities.
