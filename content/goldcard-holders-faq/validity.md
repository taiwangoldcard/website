## How long is a gold card valid?

By default, between one and three years. If you are concerned your card (or underlying visa/work
permit) may have become invalid or expired, you can check with the National Immigration Agency.

## Can I renew my gold card?

No. There is no renewal capability for a Gold Card. You must complete the same application process
you went through for your first card for all subsequent cards. Keep this in mind when planning your
time in Taiwan - you must still meet the qualification criteria in order to receive another card.

## When does the gold card's validity begin?

When the application is officially approved. You will receive an email from the application portal.
Importantly: your cards' validity can start before you enter Taiwan or pick up your card. Keep
this in mind when planning your move to Taiwan.
