    <h1>What is the Gold Card?</h1><p>The Taiwan Employment Gold Card is a combined visa, work permit and residence permit launched in 2018
to attract professional talent in Taiwan. The card gives you the right to stay and work in Taiwan for
1 year to 3 years, and you can apply online without sponsorship. The card comes with open
work rights, so you may work for any (or multiple) company in Taiwan or start your own business.
You can bring your family with you, and visitor rights for parents and grandparents are also included.
There are tax incentives for cardholders with high salaries.</p>
<p>Qualification is based on an asssessment of your professional skills, you don&rsquo;t need to have already
secured a job in Taiwan. The Gold Card costs between USD100 and USD310 depending on your nationality and
the duration of your card.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-the-application-take">How long does the application take?</h2>
<p>A perfect application takes 30 days, if your supporting documents are accepted the first time
around. If you are asked for tweaks to your supporting documents, expect 50-60 days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen &lsquo;normal&rsquo; applications take as long as 80 days. Applicants who
elected to pick their card up overseas are severely affected by the pandemic&rsquo;s impact on the postal
network.</p>
</blockquote>
<!---TODO revise in a few months.-->
<h2 id="do-i-apply-for-the-gold-card-personally-or-should-i-ask-my-employer-to-do-that">Do I apply for the Gold Card personally, or should I ask my employer to do that?</h2>
<p>Generally you should apply personally. Employers can help with the process, but you do not need
their sponsorship or support to apply for the card. Additionally, the card once issued contains
an open work permit that allows you to work for any company. If someone is asking you for large sums
of money to help with your gold card application, it could be a scam.</p>
<h2 id="what-fees-are-involved-in-a-gold-card-application">What fees are involved in a Gold Card application?</h2>
<p>There is only one fee, which is paid through the Gold Card application portal. There are no separate visa or work permit fees.</p>
<p>The fees varies if you apply from Taiwan or overseas, the duration of the visa, and your nationality.
You can check <a href="https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card">the &ldquo;Fees for Employment Gold Card&rdquo; section of the application portal</a>.</p>
<!---TODO add fee reference.-->
<h2 id="who-can-i-talk-to-about-this">Who can I talk to about this?</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to discuss: whether you should apply, benefits of the program, or any early questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/Default.aspx">Foreign Talent Act website</a></li>
<li>Ask <a href="https://www.contacttaiwan.tw/main/index.aspx?lang=2#">Contact Taiwan</a>. They are a Government-funded organisation whose mission is to help you find a job. They&rsquo;ll direct you to the right place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, look at the <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=D927ED39BDAE7478&amp;s=DA2F7BC919B77E24">master contact list</a> to talk about:</p>
<ul>
<li>tax incentives: the NIA can sometimes provide some basic information about this, otherwise contact the Ministry of Finance under <em>Reduction or Exemption of Income Tax of Foreign Special Professionals</em> on the master list</li>
<li>visas for your spouse/family: Contact NIA, under the <em>Ministry of Interior for Employment Gold Card Permits for Foreign Special P    rofessionals</em> on the master list</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-you-need-to-undergo-a-health-check-to-apply-for-the-gold-card">Do you need to undergo a health check to apply for the Gold Card?</h2>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t heard of anyone to date who required a health check, so it&rsquo;s not a normal part of the
process at least.</p>
