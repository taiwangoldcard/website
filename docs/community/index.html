As the China General Manager, I look after our China team of 10+ people across A&amp;R, Rights Management and Marketing Departments, and I&rsquo;m currently leading deployment of investment capital from our recent funding into various recording &amp; publishing rights projects. While most of my work is done remotely, I do still work with several Taiwan artists, including Sunset Rollercoaster, Jolin Tsai, Jay Chou, Mayday, Accusefive and many others.</p>

As a CFA Charterholder, I&rsquo;ve held executive roles at several investment banks managing trading and portfolio management teams in the US, Tokyo and Hong Kong and served as head of investments for an university endowment and state pension. I switched careers in 2014 to become a NLP and machine learning researcher.</p>
<p><strong>Why Taiwan?</strong>: After coming in 2020 to help care for my father-in-law, I realized the tremendous opportunity for Taiwan to lead in new technology and decided to stay and help contribute to its succcess while enjoying the beauty, culture and safe lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>What are you currently doing in Taiwan?</strong> I spent last year writing and publishing a new book on <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-83356-5">&ldquo;Explainable Artificial Intelligence, an Introduction to Interpretable Machine Learning&rdquo;</a>. I am currently launching a tech startup here in New Taipei City.</p>

    <div class="gold-card-holder__details"><p><strong>Background</strong>: I have 16 years of experience in IoT/Telecom industry with a specialization in Cellular and GNSS/Positioning modules. I have worked in senior sales and marketing roles in companies like ZTE, Quectel, GlobalTop and Sierra Wireless.</p>
<p><strong>Why Taiwan?</strong>: I was in Germany when I got the offer to join a leading Taiwanese GPS module maker. I was unsure about Taiwan, so I came for a one week visit at first. I immediately fell in love with the amazing southern city of Tainan. I moved to Taiwan in 2014. Later, I had the privilege to be a part of the first batch of foreigners to receive the Gold Card in 2018. It’s easily one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve ever made.</p>
<p><strong>What are you currently doing in Taiwan?</strong>: I head sales and marketing for Thrutek Applied Materials, which is one of the leading manufacturers of AlN powder globally. I also help my wife run a small business that offers facilitation services to Filipino OFWs in Taiwan.

<p>In 2022, I transitioned from Gold Card to full Taiwanese citizenship which I am immensely proud of.</p>

    <h4 class="gold-card-holder__category">Economy</h4>
    

    <div class="gold-card-holder__details"><p><strong>Background</strong>: Moroccan with degrees in Science from France (Msc) and Germany (PhD), I was naturalized Canadian in late 2018.
I completed my PhD in 2009 in the midst of the financial crisis. There were no European work permits to be provided for North-Africans like me, even with a PhD in Science. I applied for the Singaporean program EPEC, a grad student friend of mine had pointed me to, and was approved after three weeks only. I left for Singapore where I started my Regulatory career at P&amp;G, it was an amazing experience! Ironically, when I was contemplating applying for the TW Gold Card, I read that it was designed after the Singaporean EPEC. This is the point at which I knew I would qualify if I applied. I am very glad to be back to Asia.</p>
<p><strong>Why Taiwan?</strong>: The Medtech industry is very dynamic here with incredible talent and innovation that needs exporting. The pro-democracy spirit here is also something unique in Asia. Everything is open to discussion and while the Taiwanese are grappling with their identity, they understand what it means to be a silenced minority, listen with genuine curiosity to other groups and don&rsquo;t shy away from contributing to the world. I find the overall energy to be hopeful, inspiring and motivating.</p>
<p><strong>What are you currently doing in Taiwan?</strong>: Setting up a branch of my business in TW, building relationships particularly with local incubators and accelerator programs, seeking clients, and hopefully starting to make some money very very soon.</p>
<p>Staying in Taiwan was not in my plan. I was going to be here for six months, accompany my partner for his exchange, take Chinese lessons, study for a professional certification exam, and do lots of business intelligence here, in China and Singapore. When the Covid outbreak happened my partner and I weighed every week the pros and cons of staying vs. returning to BC. Quickly after that I understood that I had before me a business opportunity, being in the MedTech industry, I could not turn away from. Manufacturing sites were still running in TW, large MedTech MNCs were/are still talking about deglobalizing and moving some of the manufacturing outside of China and President Tsai making MedTech a high priority sector. It was clear Taiwan was the place to be for my business. This is how I ended up applying for the Gold Card.</p>

    <div class="gold-card-holder__details"><p><strong>Background</strong>: I&rsquo;m originally from Hong Kong and grew up in the United States. I have a BA from the University of Pennsylvania and an MBA and MPH from Boston University. My background is primarily in hospital administration, health policy research, and medical device startups. I am also involved in church and recently helped start <a href="http://www.thrivetaipei.com/">Thrive Church</a> that ministers to college students and young adults in Taipei.</p>
<p><strong>Why Taiwan?</strong>: I used to visit Taiwan almost every year for the past decade on work-related trips and saw just how amazing this country is and how friendly the people are. When an opportunity opened up to help in a research and education initiative in Taipei, it seemed like a great fit so my family relocated from Boston a couple years ago. As I have spent more time in Taiwan, it further cemented the feeling that we made the right decision: 1) convenience - efficient public transportation system in Taipei, 7-elevens on every block, restaurants and grocery stores within easy reach, 2) social equality - universal health care coverage and civil liberties, 3) people - warm, friendly, and helpful, 4) safe, and 5) Costco - there are 5 in Taipei!</p>
<p><strong>What are you currently doing in Taiwan?</strong> I help run the <a href="http://www.newschooltaiwan.org/">New School for Leadership in Healthcare</a> which is located at the Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center. The New School is a two-year training program that takes mid-career professionals in healthcare fields (e.g. medicine, industry, government, academia) and teaches them to understand all aspects of health systems from understanding healthcare management, to improving healthcare quality, to imagining the future of healthcare. The goal is to ultimately train the next Minister of Health or the next leader of a health system, large or small, from community clinics to global institutes. We equip our scholars to manage healthcare crises and improve healthcare delivery, quality, and value.</p>
<p>I am a co-author on the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762689">JAMA paper</a> that raised Taiwan&rsquo;s profile to the international community for its excellent COVID-19 response: I continue to be on the lookout for interesting healthcare startups and folks who are thinking critically about health policy reform.</p>

<p><strong>What are you currently doing in Taiwan?</strong> I&rsquo;m currently teaching kids about technology at Skyrock Projects. We work on coding, robotics, and maker skills!</p>
<p>Within my 3 years of having the Gold Card visa, I want to establish an energy technology startup company, develop key resources and partners in Taiwan, and then commercialize the technology to Africa.</p>
