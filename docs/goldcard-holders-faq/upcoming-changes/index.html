    <h1>Upcoming Changes</h1><p>On June 18th 2021, a major amendment to the law underpinning the Gold Card
was passed by the legislature. It&rsquo;s since been signed into law by the President
and is currently being implemented by the various government department responsible.</p>
<p>At lot of things are still unclear.
This page contains fully unofficial information based on what we know about the law,
please confirm with relevant authorities before acting!</p>
<h2 id="when-can-i-get-the-good-stuff-from-the-new-law">When can I get the good stuff from the new law?</h2>
<p>October 2021.</p>
<h2 id="i-can-get-permanent-residence-aprc-after-3-years-now">I can get permanent residence (APRC) after 3 years now?</h2>
<p>Yes, if:</p>
<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s been more than 3 years (to the day) since you entered Taiwan on your Gold Card</li>
<li>you spent an average of more than 183 days a year in Taiwan during those 3 years</li>
<li>you didn&rsquo;t do any Bad Things while you were here</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get confused: it&rsquo;s not calendar years, it&rsquo;s counted based on your first entry date,
you cannot apply before 3 full years have passed regardless of how many days you&rsquo;ve been
in Taiwan.</p>
<p>One crucial thing: your Gold Card will probably expire before you reach the 3 year
residence mark and are able to complete the application for permanent residence. Consider
whether you need to start a renewal of your card early or apply for an extension.
If there&rsquo;s a gap in your residence, you might become ineligible.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-just-for-gold-card-holders">Is this just for Gold Card holders?</h2>
<p>Yes, unless you have a Foreign Special Professional Work Permit (probably because
you work in the offshore wind power industry, or some other highly specialised domain
with an awesome HR department).</p>
<h2 id="how-often-does-an-aprc-need-to-be-renewed">How often does an APRC need to be renewed?</h2>
<p>This is permanent residence for life, you just need to visit Taiwan once every 5 years.</p>
<h2 id="does-my-time-on-a-regular-arc-pre-gold-card-count-towards-the-3-years">Does my time on a regular ARC pre-gold-card count towards the 3 years?</h2>
<p>No. Though keep in mind &lsquo;regular&rsquo; APRC after 5 years is probably still an option for you.</p>
<h2 id="i-hear-tax-benefits-for-gold-card-holders-have-been-extended">I hear tax benefits for Gold Card holders have been extended?</h2>
<p>Yes, the confusing deferral scheme has been replaced with a straight 5 year eligibility period.
The benefit and qualification within a given year remains the same.</p>
<h2 id="once-i-convert-to-aprc-am-i-still-entitled-to-the-same-tax-benefit-as-gold-card-holders">Once I convert to APRC, am I still entitled to the same tax benefit as gold card holders?</h2>
<p>No, unless you get an additional Foreign Special Professional work permit.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-any-other-changes-when-moving-from-gold-card-to-aprc">Are there any other changes when moving from Gold Card to APRC?</h2>
<p>Pretty much all of the other benefits you have as a Gold Card holder carry over, and you get some more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Never have to worry about your visa, ever again (provided you visit Taiwan once every 5 years)</li>
<li>Automatic open work permit (work for any or as many employers as you want)</li>
<li>Continue to be able to sponsor parents/grandparents for a longer visitor visa than other residents</li>
<li>Continued access to National Health Insurance</li>
<li>Your family can continue to stay with you :)</li>
<li>Ability to apply for the  Mackay Project, which provides benefits (eg discounts) after retirement (65 years old)</li>
</ul>
